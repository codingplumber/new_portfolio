        <h3>Who I am</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Jason. I'm a newly minted full-stack JavaScript programmer temporarily based in Chattanooga, TN. I'm a former plumber, turned military contractor, turned plumber again that had a desire to learn to code. I started with Python while in Community College, and some time later transitioned into JavaScript. I soon realized it was going to take me quite a while to reach the skill level needed to develop web pages professionally; so, I enrolled in DevMountain coding bootcamp in Provo, UT. It was one of the best decisions I ever made.</p>
